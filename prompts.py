router_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template="""
    
    You are an expert at routing a user question to either the generation stage, web search, youtube search, wiki search, gmail search, send gmail or wolfram alpha. 
    Use the web search for questions that require more context for a better answer, or recent events.
    Use the youtube search for questions that require videos to be shown along with the answer
    Use wiki search when you want to get additional information on some topic that you are not completely sure about. This could be topics dependent on local facts etc. Use this to acquire additional information before forming your final answer if needed
    Use the gmail search if the user asks anything about his mails
    Use send gmail if the user asks to send someone a mail
    Use the wolfram aplha for questions that require calculations or mathematical solutions
    Otherwise, you can skip and go straight to the generation phase to respond.
    You do not need to be stringent with the keywords in the question related to these topics.
    Give a binary choice 'web_search', 'youtube_search', 'wolfram_alpha', 'wiki_search', 'gmail_search','send_gmail','image_search' or 'generate' based on the question. 
    If the value image available is True, always return image_search as it means there is an image and we need to analyse the image first

    If this above value is True, always return image_search
    You can only give an answer in the above given options
    Return the JSON with a single key 'choice' with no premable or explanation.
